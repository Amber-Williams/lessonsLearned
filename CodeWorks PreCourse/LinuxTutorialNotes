The Terminal
________________________________

2. NAVIGATION
pwd
 stands for Print Working Directory, this tells us what our current directory is.

ls
 stands for list, this tells us our current location.


Paths -
A) Absolute Path: specifies a specific file or directory in relation to the root directory
B) Relative Path: Specifies a location in relation to where we currently are in the system
C) ~ : called tilde; can refer to a path such as /home/user/Documents or using tilde ~/Documents
D) . : called dot; seems a lot like tilde
E) .. : called dot dot; used to go back up the hierarchy closer to the root folder (e.g. ../../ )


cd
 stands for change directory, it is used to go into a defined location using cd[location]. If you just use cd on its own it will take you back to your home directory.



3. MORE ABOUT FILES

Everything is a file, be it your keyboard, a text file or even your monitor

File extension
 (E.g.  .txt  .ai  .html)

file[path]
 Is a command to find out which type of file it is

Linux is case sensitive

If there are spaces in a file name, to access it you need to use Quotes("" | '') or Escape Characters ( \ )

Hidden files
 A) To create a hidden file:  name it with a dot (.) at the beginning
 B) To show hidden files:  ls -a   command will list the contents of a directory and include hidden files (-a   command stands for all)

6. Vi TEXT EDITOR

Vi
  A) Is a command line text editor like Notepad
  B) Has 2 modes:
	I) Insert mode - input or enter content into the file
	II) Edit Mode  - move around the file, deleting/copying/searching/replacing/saving etc.

	II:  :q!  - discard all changes, since the last save, and exit
	III:  :w  - save file but don't exit
	IV:   :wq - save and exit

 
cat <file> 
  A) view a files contents


***Had more notes on navigating the text editor I wouldn't use



7. WILDCARDS

* - represents zero or more characters
? - represents a single character (e.g. ???I* is looking for 4th letter I)

Seems like placement of * can be used before <file/directory> and after in different cases
 - file name <file>*
 - file extension *<.ext>

[] 
  - represents a range of characters
  - ls [ac]*   is every file whose name begins with a or c
  - ls [a-c]*  is every file whose name begins with a through c
  - ls *[0-9]* is every file that contains 0-9
  - ls [^a-z]* is every file that does NOT contain a-z (***don't understand this one)



8. PERMISSIONS


r
  Command read - you may view the contents of the file.

w
  Command write - you may change the contents of the file.

x
  Command execute - you may execute or run the file if it is a program or script.


owner
  Command - a single person who owns the file. (typically the person who created the file but ownership may be granted to some one else by certain users)

group
  Command - every file belongs to a single group.

others
  Command - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner.


ls -l [path]
  A)Command to view permissions
  B) What we get:
	I: first character identifies the file type ( dash is normal file || d is directory)
	II: following 3 character represent the permissions for the owner( r/w/x)
	III: following 3 char. Represent the permissions for the group
	IV: finally the last 3 char. Represent the permissions for others

chmod [permissions] [path]
  A)Command to change permissions
  B)[ugoa] - user (or owner), group, others, all
  C) granting or revoking the permission - indicated with either a plus ( + ) or minus ( - )
  D)read ( r ), write ( w ) or execute ( x )
  E) There is a short hand in binary if you want to learn it


The root user, usually only 2 of these who may change all permissions of a file or directory

For home directories, its common practice to only give yourself permissions and the rest group/others no permissions



9. FILTERS

Filters often have various command line options that modify their behavior, thus it is good practice to check out the man (manual) page for a filter to see what is available.

head [-number of lines to print] [path]
  Command that prints the first so many lines of its input
  *** not sure I understand this

tail [-number of lines to print] [path]
  Command that prints the LAST so many lines of its input

sort [-options] [path]
  Command that by default sorts alphabetically (but can differently sort with different options)

wc [-options] [path]
  Command that counts words, as well as characters and lines by default (but can limit what we are after using options)

cut [-options] [path]
  Command that will cut content into separated fields 

sed <expression> [path]
  Stands for Steam editor
  Command that allows us to search and replace data
  (E.g   s/search/replace/g    ||   sed 's/oranges/bananas/g' mysampledata.txt  )

uniq [options] [path]
  Command to remove duplicate lines from the data

tac [path]
  Command performs cat command but in reverse



10. GREP AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

RegExp's are typically used to identify and manipulate specific pieces of data.

egrep [command line options] <pattern> [path]
  A)Command that will search given set of data for a string/number and print what matches
  B) egrep -n 'searchword' mysampledata.txt = line number
  C) egrep -c 'searchword' mysampledata.txt = how many lines matched

https://www.debuggex.com/   -  online tool to experiment with regular expressions

- OVER VIEW OF REGEXPS -
. (dot) - a single character.
? - the preceding character matches 0 or 1 times only.
* - the preceding character matches 0 or more times.
+ - the preceding character matches 1 or more times.
{n} - the preceding character matches exactly n times.
{n,m} - the preceding character matches at least n times and not more than m times.
[agd] - the character is one of those included within the square brackets.
[^agd] - the character is not one of those included within the square brackets.
[c-f] - the dash within the square brackets operates as a range. In this case it means either the letters c, d, e or f.
() - allows us to group several characters to behave as one.
| (pipe symbol) - the logical OR operation.
^ - matches the beginning of the line.
$ - matches the end of the line.



11. PIPING AND REDIRECTION (*** Need to study more on this section)

STDIN (0) - Standard input (data fed into the program)
STDOUT (1) - Standard output (data printed by the program, defaults to the terminal)
STDERR (2) - Standard error (for error messages, also defaults to the terminal)

> 
 A)Command that indicates to send terminal's output into a saved file instead of printed to the screen 
 B)used like:   ls > fileNameYouWish  
 C)If we save to a file name that already exists, its contents will be CLEARED and the new output saved to it
 
>>
 Command that APPENDS new terminal output into a saved file...instead of printing to the screen

<
 ***Command that sends data opposite from >

<number>>
  A) e.g. 3> or 4>
  B)***Command that will redirect that stream

|
  Command to send data from one program to another


12. PROCESS MANAGEMENT

top
  Command that gives us a snapshot of what is currently happening on the system

ps [aux]
  Command that will show you just the processes running in your current terminal
  + Aux argument will show a complete system view which is a bit more helpful

Finding out a process' ID (PID) - using (  ps aux | grep 'firefox'  )

kill [signal] <PID>
  Command that will kill a process using specific PID


jobs
  Command that lists currently running background jobs for us

sleep <number of seconds>
  A)***Command that will run the program in the background and then we can continue working
  B)Adding an ampersand (&) at the end of the command we are telling the terminal to run this process in the background.

fg <job number>
  Command that stands for foreground to bring background processes into the foreground



13. BASH SCRIPTING

Bash scripts are handy if a particular task is done often, or it is repetitive, then a script can be a useful tool.

Bash script is read and acted upon by an INTERPRETER.

Bash script scripts = terminal commands on a command line

shebang: first two characters of the first line in a script (after this will be the path to the interpreter)

which <program>
  Command to find out where our interpreter is located (useful for scripts)

#
 put this into scripts
 This helps comment code out...useful to add your name, date and what the script does in each beginning of a script


Linux is an extension-less system (meaning when you call files you don't need to add their dot extensions)

./<file>
  Command to look for file/script in current directory

chmod 755 <script>
  Command to ensure script is set up right and you have permission to execute (you don't have this by default)

Variables
  A) is a container for simple piece of data
  B) <variable name>='value'
  C) e.g. name='Amber'   (to call use the $ symbol ->  $name  )

Command line arguments
   $0 - The name of the script.
   $1 - $9 - Any command line arguments given to the script. $1 is the first argument, $2 the second and so on.
   $# - How many command line arguments were given to the script.
   $* - All of the command line arguments.


backticks(`)
  A)It is possible to save the output of a command to a variable 
  B)e.g.  lines=`cat $1 | wc -l`

You can add if statements to a script



BONUS MATERIAL

Task scheduling

***** command to execute
  A)Where the *'s represent (in order from left to right:

    Minutes (0 - 59)
    Hours (0 - 23)
    Day of Month (1 - 31)
    Months (1 - 12)
    Day of week (0 - 7) (0 and 7 are Sunday)

  B)e.g. 30 3 * * 4 /bin/myscript.sh   ->  Execute myscript.sh every Thursday at 3:30am


crontab -l
  Command that views tasks that you currently have scheduled 

crontab -e
  Command to edit your scheduled tasks in your default text editor
