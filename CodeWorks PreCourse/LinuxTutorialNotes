7. WILDCARDS

* - represents zero or more characters
? - represents a single character (e.g. ???I* is looking for 4th letter I)

Seems like placement of * can be used before <file/directory> and after in different cases
 - file name <file>*
 - file extension *<.ext>

[] 
  - represents a range of characters
  - ls [ac]*   is every file whose name begins with a or c
  - ls [a-c]*  is every file whose name begins with a through c
  - ls *[0-9]* is every file that contains 0-9
  - ls [^a-z]* is every file that does NOT contain a-z (***don't understand this one)



8. PERMISSIONS


r
  Command read - you may view the contents of the file.

w
  Command write - you may change the contents of the file.

x
  Command execute - you may execute or run the file if it is a program or script.


owner
  Command - a single person who owns the file. (typically the person who created the file but ownership may be granted to some one else by certain users)

group
  Command - every file belongs to a single group.

others
  Command - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner.


ls -l [path]
  A)Command to view permissions
  B) What we get:
	I: first character identifies the file type ( dash is normal file || d is directory)
	II: following 3 character represent the permissions for the owner( r/w/x)
	III: following 3 char. Represent the permissions for the group
	IV: finally the last 3 char. Represent the permissions for others

chmod [permissions] [path]
  A)Command to change permissions
  B)[ugoa] - user (or owner), group, others, all
  C) granting or revoking the permission - indicated with either a plus ( + ) or minus ( - )
  D)read ( r ), write ( w ) or execute ( x )
  E) There is a short hand in binary if you want to learn it


The root user, usually only 2 of these who may change all permissions of a file or directory

For home directories, its common practice to only give yourself permissions and the rest group/others no permissions
