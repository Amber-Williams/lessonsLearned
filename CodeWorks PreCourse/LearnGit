Git is a Version Control System 
- Track changes
- Easily swap versions
- Undo changes
- Ideal for teams

Git VS GitHub
(GitHub is a remote repository and only stores code)

Branches

Rebaseing
- interactive rebase means using the rebase command with the  -i  option: will open u a UI of what the commit tree looks like

Checkout

Commit

HEAD
-symbolic name for the currently checked out commit...its essentially what commit you're working on top of. Most recent commit
-Detaching HEAD

git log
- to see hashes or "commit tree"

Relative refs/Relative commits

^ 
- operator to move through the commit tree level by level
- ^^^ moves three levels back

~
- operator takes in a trailing number that specifies the number of parents you would like to ascend (short hand for using ^)

E.g.  Git branch -f master HEAD~3
- (-f) directly reassign a branch to a commit tree location

reset
- works to undo work locally for individual use

Revert
- works to undo work remotely for teams

cherry-pick
- copy a series of commits below your current location
- Works great when you know which commits you want and their corresponding hashes

Steps to set up Git and link it to GitHub
1. Download git here - https://git-scm.com/download/mac
2. Create GitHub account if you don't have one
3. In the terminal type:
      git config --global user.name "Your name here"
      git config --global user.email "youremail@yahoo.com"
4. Getting past applying password after each commit:
     A) check for SSH key in terminal:   ls ~/.ssh
     B) if you get "no such file or directory" you need to create an SSH key
     C) Creating an SSH Key:    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@yahoo.com"
	- Can name file...but just push enter for the following instructions to work
	- This will as for a passphrase you can leave empty for no passphrase
     Ca) GitHub documentation added extra step called adding your SSH Key to the ssh-agent: (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
		eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"          
		[enter] then.     
		ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     D) Copy the SSH Key:
		i) Windows:  clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
		ii) Linux: sudo apt-get install xclip
       				 xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
		iii) Mac: pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     E) This will copy the SSH key to your paste keyboard, go to log into GitHub -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> Add New key -> paste copied key into key box and add whatever title of your choosing (I chose what specified computer I was working from as a title)

     (Optional) If you already have SSH Key use the file name in place of the id_rsa.pub file
