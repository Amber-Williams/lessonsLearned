1. Boolean Values (true, false) 
  - are basically little on-off switches
  - example below:   illustrates how you can use a parameter to create an on/off switch


function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
     return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}
test(true);    // returns "It was true"
test(false);  // returns "It was false"


//END Boolean on off switch example 


2. Equality Operator (==) V.S. Strict Equality (===)
  - Equality operator will work to being compared to a string vs a number (e.g. 1 == "1" is true)
  - Strict Equality will strictly only work if similar types (e.g. 1 === "1" is false)



3. Typeof
  - typeof <variable> can help determine what the variable type is(eg string/number/boolean)
