# Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments

==Syntax Parser== : A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.

==Lexical Environment== : Where something sits physically in the code you write. (e.g. a varible inside a function)

==Execution Context== : A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. 

- Objects are really just a collection of name to value pairs
